This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [Unreal Engine 4 VR Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com)

This project is your first chance to make a game within Unreal Engine 4 for either standing or room-scale VR. You’ll need to utilize motion controllers to build a kitchen-themed interaction game, and you’ll use functions, physics, blueprint communication, and audio to create an immersive experience. Spawn messy dishes and get them into the sink as quickly as possible!

## Game description

This is a kitchen-themed interaction game. The goal is to wash as much plates as possible during the 60 seconds time interval. 
The game utilizes a single motion controller. To start/stop the game the user should use the trigger button of the controller. Plates are spawned in one of 8 locations in the kitchen. Using the wand and the left grip button of the controller, the user can pick up plates and put them into sink to increase the score. Plates which are already inside the sink can't be picked up. The left time and current score are displayed on TV screen.
